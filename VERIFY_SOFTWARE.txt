Verification of the bitgen software
===================================

It is important to verify that the bitgen software has not been changed.

This is done by verifying the signature of the software package.

Two methods are used to sign a bitgen software package:
bitsig and gpg.

bitsig is the preferred alternative, but best is to use both of them.
However, bitsig verification require that the bitsig software has
already been installed. When installing bitgen/bitsig for the first
time, GPG can be used instead since this software already exists in many cases.


Verification using bitsig
=========================
Verification with bitsig is done with the following command:

$ bitsig verify bitgen_n.nn.tar.gz

The folder should contain the two files:
* bitgen_n.nn.tar.gz
* bitgen_n.nn.tar.gz.bitsig

The bitsig printout should look like this:
> Verify OK for address: 1L5TnzknDGZuHde9Uz8mBjZAq6tz8MnN97

The signing address is 1L5TnzknDGZuHde9Uz8mBjZAq6tz8MnN97, 
but this should be *double checked* with other sources, 
such as internet forums. 

Also, older versions of bitgen that have been downloaded will
contain this information (starting with version 0.17), so older
software packages can be used as a source of signature address.

Verification using gpg
======================
In order to verify with gpg, the bitgen gpg public key has to be imported.
Import is done with the following command:

$ gpg --import bitgen_public.gpg

The file "bitgen_public.gpg" is included in this software package.
However, it is important that the gpg public key is verified
for authenticity.

The gpg key fingerprint is:
60A4 5D96 0CAF 0923 19FF  F2D0 71DF C6C3 CAA8 F7CB

However, this information should be *double-checked* with other 
sources such as internet forums. Note that older versions of bitgen
that have been downloaded will contain this information.

Verification with gpg is done with the following command

$ gpg --verify bitgen_n.nn.tar.gz.asc 

The folder should contain the two files:
* bitgen_n.nn.tar.gz
* bitgen_n.nn.tar.gz.asc

The gpg  printout should look like this:
gpg: Good signature
